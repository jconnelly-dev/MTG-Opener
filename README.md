# MTG-Opener
This is a personal project that I'm starting to help me practice mulligans and keep statistics on opening magic the gathering hands. I'll start off with everything just for Neobrand to help prep for GP Vegas next week, but will be designed such that it can easily be changed for any deck :) FUN :)!!!
